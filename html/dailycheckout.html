                    <p>A consistent visual identity involves more than just the website; using varied styles for the same elements across pages creates confusion. To address this, a style guide defines the visual and functional design standards.

                        Team Activities:
                        Developing a Style Guide: Establish unified design principles.
                        Creating a Shared Stylesheet: Ensure consistency in implementation.</p>
